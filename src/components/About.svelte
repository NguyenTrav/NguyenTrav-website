          I'm a developer that draws inspiration from films, art, and the people around me. The storytelling, cinematography, and emotional depth of movies have shaped my approach to development and design. 
          I thrive in environments where art meets strategy, and believe in crafting accessible user experiences that resonate with audiences. 
       </p>  
       <p class="mb-4">
          My time as a full stack developer, designer and systems engineer bring a unique perspective in addressing human problems through digital mediums. 
          By drawing from art, I bring fresh, imaginative ideas to every project I take on.
       </p>

          Catch me at the theatre watching the latest A24 movie, traveling with my film camera, or bouldering to get over my fear of heights.
